push_swap is a programming project that requires you to write a program that sorts a stack of integers using two other stacks and a set of rules. The program must sort the stack in the fewest possible number of moves and adhere to a strict set of rules for manipulating the stacks. The push_swap project is often assigned as part of the curriculum at 42, a coding school, and is designed to test your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. The project is challenging but provides a valuable opportunity to practice implementing complex sorting algorithms and data structures in C.
